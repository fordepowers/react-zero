# React Zero
> A minimal create-react-app boilerplate, for just the stuff you need and nothing you don't.

## Features
Literally nothing. In fact we removed quite a bit:
- No testing framework built in
- No linting built in
- Removed all but one of the logo images
- Removed all the web vital scripts

## Why this?
For hackathons and other one off projects, I got tired of removing things from the CRA script to get back to barebones.

And yet I also wanted the flexability of still running `npx create-react-app` and not having to do a node app from scratch.

Thus, this was born.
